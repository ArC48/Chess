with each player controlling an army of 16 pieces, including a king, queen, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns. Each piece has its own symbol: 
- ♔ for king
- ♕ for queen
- ♖ for rook
- ♘ for knight
- ♗ for bishop
- ♙ for pawn. 

Players take turns moving their pieces strategically to capture their opponent's pieces and ultimately checkmate their opponent's king.

### Brief Explanation of How Each Chess Piece Moves

- **King (♔):** The king can move one square in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- **Queen (♕):** The queen combines the movement of the rook and the bishop. It can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- **Rook (♖):** The rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, but it cannot jump over other pieces.

- **Knight (♘):** The knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction (horizontally or vertically), and then one square perpendicular to that direction. It's the only piece that can jump over other pieces.

- **Bishop (♗):** The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but like the rook, it cannot jump over other pieces.

- **Pawn (♙):** Pawns have a unique movement. They can move forward one square, but on their first move, they have the option to move forward two squares. Pawns capture diagonally, one square forward diagonally to the left or right.
